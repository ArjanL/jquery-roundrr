jQuery Roundrr
-----------------------------

Roundrr is a plugin for plotting interactive image or multimedia content around a circle. It is based on RadMenu with an extended model for events occurring in the pre and post animation phases. It also contains further configuration for automated playback of a wheel of content and support for 'pick' interfaces which allow you to perform an action when an object falls between two other objects of fixed known position.
